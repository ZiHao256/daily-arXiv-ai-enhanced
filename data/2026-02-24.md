Abstract: We initiate the study of multi-attribute group fairness in $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) search over vector databases. Unlike prior work that optimizes efficiency or query filtering, fairness imposes count constraints to ensure proportional representation across groups defined by protected attributes. When fairness spans multiple attributes, these constraints must be satisfied simultaneously, making the problem computationally hard. To address this, we propose a computational framework that produces high-quality approximate nearest neighbors with good trade-offs between search time, memory/indexing cost, and recall. We adapt locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to accelerate candidate generation and build a lightweight index over the Cartesian product of protected attribute values. Our framework retrieves candidates satisfying joint count constraints and then applies a post-processing stage to construct fair $k$-NN results across all attributes. For 2 attributes, we present an exact polynomial-time flow-based algorithm; for 3 or more, we formulate ILP-based exact solutions with higher computational cost. We provide theoretical guarantees, identify efficiency--fairness trade-offs, and empirically show that existing vector search methods cannot be directly adapted for fairness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the generality of the proposed framework and scalability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Long-horizon agents often compress interaction histories into write-time summaries. This creates a fundamental write-before-query barrier: compression decisions are made before the system knows what a future query will hinge on. As a result, summaries can cause unverifiable omissions -- decisive constraints (e.g., allergies) may be dropped, leaving the agent unable to justify an answer with traceable evidence. Retaining raw logs restores an authoritative source of truth, but grounding on raw logs by default is expensive: many queries are answerable from summaries, yet raw grounding still requires processing far longer contexts, inflating token consumption and latency.
  We propose TierMem, a provenance-linked framework that casts retrieval as an inference-time evidence allocation problem. TierMem uses a two-tier memory hierarchy to answer with the cheapest sufficient evidence: it queries a fast summary index by default, and a runtime sufficiency router Escalates to an immutable raw-log store only when summary evidence is insufficient. TierMem then writes back verified findings as new summary units linked to their raw sources. On LoCoMo, TierMem achieves 0.851 accuracy (vs.0.873 raw-only) while reducing input tokens by 54.1\% and latency by 60.7%.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Filtered ANN search is an increasingly important problem in vector retrieval, yet systems face a difficult trade-off due to the execution order: Pre-filtering (filtering first, then ANN over the passing subset) requires expensive per-predicate index construction, while post-filtering (ANN first, then filtering candidates) may waste computation and lose recall under low selectivity due to insufficient candidates after filtering. We introduce a learning-based query planning framework that dynamically selects the most effective execution plan for each query, using lightweight predictions derived from dataset and query statistics (e.g., dimensionality, corpus size, distribution features, and predicate statistics). The framework supports diverse filter types, including categorical/keyword and range predicates, and is generic to use any backend ANN index. Experiments show that our method achieves up to 4x acceleration with >= 90% recall comparing to the strong baselines.

Abstract: Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling is commonly taught as a primarily technical activity, despite its central role in shaping how data systems represent people, processes, and institutions. Prior research in participatory design demonstrates that involving diverse stakeholders in modeling can surface tacit knowledge, challenge implicit assumptions, and produce more inclusive data representations. However, database education currently lacks structured pedagogical approaches for teaching participatory ER modeling in practice.
  We introduce the GARLIC methodology for teaching and learning participatory ER modeling. GARLIC adapts and extends the ONION participatory ER modeling framework of Makovska et al.(HILDA 2025) into a workshop-based learning format that combines role-playing, collaborative synthesis, guided critique, and iterative refinement. GARLIC is designed to develop both technical modeling skills and critical awareness of the social and ethical dimensions of data representation. GARLIC lowers the barrier to participatory ER modeling and equips students with practical skills for collaborative, inclusive data model design.

Abstract: A relation consisting of tuples annotated by an element of a monoid K is called a K-relation. A K-database is a collection of K-relations. In this paper, we study entailment of inclusion dependencies over K-databases, where K is a positive commutative monoid. We establish a dichotomy regarding the axiomatisation of the entailment of inclusion dependencies over K-databases, based on whether the monoid K is weakly absorptive or weakly cancellative. We establish that, if the monoid is weakly cancellative then the standard axioms of inclusion dependencies are sound and complete for the implication problem. If the monoid is not weakly cancellative, it is weakly absorptive and the standard axioms of inclusion dependencies together with the weak symmetry axiom are sound and complete for the implication problem. In addition, we establish that the so-called balance axiom is further required, if one stipulates that the joint weights of each K-relation of a K-database need to be the same; this generalises the notion of a K-relation being a distribution. In conjunction with the balance axiom, weak symmetry axiom boils down to symmetry.
